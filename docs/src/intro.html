<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  A <b>component</b> is a fully self-contained set of styles, behaviors and
  layout. It usually solves a single problem in a way that makes it highly
  reusable. An example would be a <code>ProgressBar</code> or <code>InputToggle</code>.
</p>

  <b>Tonic</b> is a minimalist class library for building components inspired
  by <b>React</b> and <b>Web Components</b>. This page documents a collection
  of components built with Tonic as well as how to build your own components
